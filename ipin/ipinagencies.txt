IMPERIAL POST AND COMMUNICATIONS 
IMPERIAL COMMUNICATIONS
3
IPTC - Imperial Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications provides for reliable communications across the Empire.  The Telecommunications Service maintains and operates a series of long range communication stations within all regions.  These stations are used to relay both public information services (e.g. IPIN) and private communications.  On some under developed planets, the Telecommunications Service operates the planetary communications, but usually they just provide a link from the locally operated network to the interplanetary network.

The Postal Branch offers mail/parcel service throughout the Empire.  Most service is provided in the form of mail contracts given to existing passenger and cargo lines.  The Postal Branch only directly operates a relatively small number of depots and cutters to provide service to certain underserved (typically unassigned) planets.  Imperial Postal employees and inspectors oversee and monitor contract operations.
