INSTITUTES OF HIGHER LEARNING
1There are many Universities, Research and Technical Institutes, and Academies throughout the Empire.  Almost every inhabited world has at least one, oftentimes many more.  Some institutions, however, receive special recognition from the Emperor, and these are designated STUDIA.
-------------------SPACE TRAVEL
SPACE TRAVEL AND PROPULSION
3Space travel is accomplished with two different types of space engines, called "drives."  Standard, or sub-light, engines are used for maneuvering or to propel spacecraft short distances.  For travelling greater distances faster-than-light engines are necessary.  

Faster-than-light engines are called Quantum Drives, or "Q-engines."  Quantum Drives work most efficiently when operating in the presence of certain spatial conditions.  Those conditions form Quantum Corridors, also known as "Q-routes", which facilitate interstellar travel.  Quantum Drives can function outside of Quantum Corridors, but the energy requirements are considerably higher, and navigation is difficult.
