The Army of the Maran Empire was the military organization drawn from all the provinces of the Empire, serving together under the command of the Emperor.  This force has not assembled for several centuries and is considered defunct.  Some military units still retain their Empire military designations as honorific titles.<newline>-------------------<newline>FEDERATION ARMY<newline>THE FEDERATION ARMY<newline>1<newline>The Lutian Federation created yet another military formation in parallel to the other two.  It predates the Army of the Empire.  Unlike the defunct Army of the Empire, the Federation Army still operates, but its primary role is to coordinate joint operations between various states in the Empire.  However, it's rarely utilized, and when it is active, it's mostly just a small unit or two from a non-Imperial land.  Its only permanent units are small honor guards for the Imperial household. <newline>-------------------<newline>KNIGHTS<newline>KNIGHTS<newline>1<newline>Knightly orders exist throughout the Empire in a variety of forms.
