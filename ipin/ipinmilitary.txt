THE IMPERIAL ARMED FORCES

The Imperial Army and Navy refers to the forces directly under the Emperor's control, i.e. those forces raised within the lands controlled directly by the Emperor.  Other principalities maintain their own militaries.
-------------------ARMY OF THE MARAN EMPIRE
THE ARMY OF THE MARAN EMPIRE
1The Imperial Army and Navy represents the armed forces raised in the Imperial core and are under the direct command of the Emperor.  The Army of the Maran Empire was the military organization drawn from all the provinces of the Empire, serving together under the command of the Emperor.  This force has not assembled for several centuries and is considered defunct.  Some military units still retain their Empire military designations as honorific titles.
-------------------FEDERATION ARMY
THE FEDERATION ARMY
1The Lutian Federation created yet another military formation in parallel to the other two.  It predates the Army of the Empire.  Unlike the defunct Army of the Empire, the Federation Army still operates, but its primary role is to coordinate joint operations between various states in the Empire.  However, it's rarely utilized, and when it is active, it's mostly just a small unit or two from a non-Imperial land.  Its only permanent units are small honor guards for the Imperial household.
